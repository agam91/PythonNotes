List:

--> Ordered Sequence
--> Can hold varity of objects [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
--> Can also be of mixed object type

--> In python the method "type()" can be used to know the type of variable as the python supports dynamic casting
--> To check the size of any data type use function "len()"

can also use indexing and slicing as Strings

example : my_List = [1,2,3,4]

		  my_List[1] will give you 2
		  my_List[2:] will give you [3,4]

--> to conacatinate lists use + operator
	
example : list1 = [1,2,3]
		  list2 = [4,5,6]

		  list1 + list2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

 --> list are mutable list[2] and can assign any value at any index
 --> to add new item in list ".append()"			
 --> to pop out/remove the last element of the list : ".pop()" and this will also return you the popped out element.
 --> can also pop out any element on given index    : "pop(2)" will pop out element at index 2.
 --> reverse indexing also works in case of list
 --> to sort the list .sort() method use.. it will not return anything instead it sorted the calling list.
 --> NoneType the type with no value
 --> myList = list1.sort() will give you type none for myList as sort method sort the list1 and nothing gives in return
 --> reverse() to reverse the list.
 --> to get the element from nested list : myList = [1,1,[1,2]]
 										   myList[2][1] will give you 2
