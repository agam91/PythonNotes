Floor Division in python can be achieved by using //
	
	for example : 7//4 ... will give you 1

Powers  : 2**3 = 8
Sq Root : 4**.5 = 2

String formatting with place holder
	
	%s to inject strings into your print statements. The modulo % is referred to as a "string formatting operator".
	
	print("I'm going to inject %s here." %'something') : I'm going to inject something here.
	
	print("I'm going to inject %s text here, and %s text here." %('some','more')) : 
	I'm going to inject some text here, and more text here.

	x, y = 'some', 'more'
	print("I'm going to inject %s text here, and %s text here."%(x,y))
	
	I'm going to inject some text here, and more text here.

Two methods %s and %r convert any python object to a string using two separate methods: str() and repr(). 
%r and repr() deliver the string representation of the object, including quotation marks and any escape characters.
	
	print('He said his name was %r.' %'Fred') : He said his name was 'Fred'.
	
	print('I once caught a fish %r.' %'this \tbig') : I once caught a fish 'this \tbig'.

The %s operator converts whatever it sees into a string, including integers and floats. The %d operator converts numbers to integers first, without rounding
	
	print('I wrote %s programs today.' %3.75)
	print('I wrote %d programs today.' %3.75)   
	
	I wrote 3.75 programs today.
	I wrote 3 programs today.
